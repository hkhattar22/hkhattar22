## 👩‍🎓 About Me
Hi, I'm Harshita Khattar — a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about building innovative, impactful, and human-centered tech solutions. My journey so far has been a blend of creativity, curiosity, and a deep drive to continuously learn and improve.

From contributing to full-stack projects to winning my first hackathon, I thrive in fast-paced, problem-solving environments. My internship as an Application Development Intern strengthened my frontend development skills, while my work on C.L.A.S.S., an AI-powered educational platform, reflects my commitment to accessible, personalized learning experiences.

Beyond the code, I care deeply about leveraging AI for good — whether it's building a website for social good or empowering students through smart tools like resume scorers and interview prep analyzers. I'm also a lifelong art lover and dreamer with a creative eye.

Currently exploring the intersection of software engineering, AI, and education technology, I'm always looking for opportunities to grow, collaborate, and contribute meaningfully to the future of tech.
